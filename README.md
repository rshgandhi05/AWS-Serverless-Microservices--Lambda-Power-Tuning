# AWS-Serverless-Microservices--Lambda-Power-Tuning
This project establishes a serverless REST API using Amazon API Gateway that interfaces with an AWS Lambda function to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on an Amazon DynamoDB table. This pattern exemplifies a Serverless Microservice architecture, focusing on high scalability, low cost, and minimal operational overhead.
